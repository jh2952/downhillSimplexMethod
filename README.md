<h1>Downhill Simplex Method Algorithm</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

- This project consists of a C script that follows the Downhill Simplex Method - an algorithm for finding the global minimum/maximum for a function in multidimensional space. This script will take in a function, as well as the coordinates of the vertices of a simplex. It will follow the downhill simplex algorithm and converge towards a standing point; outputting the coordinates of the final simplex, the evaluation of the function at those coordinates, and the number of steps taken.
